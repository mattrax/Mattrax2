# Mattrax

Mattrax is an open source device management system. It is designed to make device management easy through its web interface and use of built-in MDM protocol to make a native experience. Platform-specific MDM features are abstracted into cross-platform alternatives to make it easier for admins to maintain devices.

## Installation
